# PlatformIO Arduino Project

## Overview
This project is an Arduino application developed using PlatformIO. It serves as a template for creating Arduino projects with a structured directory layout.

## Directory Structure
- **include/**: Contains header files for the project.
- **lib/**: Contains custom libraries used in the project.
- **src/**: Contains the main source code files. The primary file is `main.cpp`.
- **test/**: Contains unit tests for the project.
- **platformio.ini**: Configuration file for PlatformIO, specifying environment settings and libraries.

## Getting Started
1. **Install PlatformIO**: Ensure you have PlatformIO installed in your development environment.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project to your local machine.
3. **Open the Project**: Open the project folder in your IDE.
4. **Build the Project**: Use the PlatformIO build command to compile the project.
5. **Upload to Arduino**: Connect your Arduino board and upload the compiled code.

## Usage
Modify the `src/main.cpp` file to implement your Arduino application logic. Add any necessary libraries in the `lib/` directory and include them in your source files as needed.
